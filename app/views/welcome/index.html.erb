  <h1>Call to Action</h1>
  <h2>Don't just read the news.</h2>


  <p>News is entertainment. We read it, then forget it. The news cycle spins on.</p>

  <p><b>Call to Action</b> places buttons at the end of news articles with options
    of things you can do about what you've read. You can be more than just entertained.</p>



  <h3>Give me things to do!</h3>
  <p><b>Call to Action</b> is a Chrome extension. You can get it here</p>

  <h3>Who decides on the actions?</h3>
  <p>Well.... me</p>



  <h3>Why</h3>
  <p>For a long time I got frustrated with reading the news. I felt like I was
    just watching bad things happen. It made me sad</p>

  <p>My first decision was to stop reading the news. This helped. Once I'd gotten
    past my addiction, I felt liberated and happy again. Problem was, I was just
    sticking my head in the sand</p>

  <p>What I wanted was an option for something to do about what I was reading</p>
